## Usage

If you have permissions enabled to do so, you can execute the PowerShell scripts in the `test` directory via the GUI or from the root directory via the CLI. 

More likely, if you do not have permission to execute PowerShell scripts directly, you can use the `generate_exe.bat` batch script to create the executables. This script will install a FOSS PowerShell module, `ps2exe`, only for the current user and then build the executables. There will be prompts as part of the installation. The script must be launched from the `test` directory for both CLI and GUI (go to the directory and double click like usual). 

Once the execubables are generated, you can follow the same steps as for the PowerShell scripts above but with the `.exe` files instead.
